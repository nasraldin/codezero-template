# CodeZero Template - Clean Architecture, Microservice, DDD
Sample implementation of [CodeZero Framework](https://gitlab.com/nasraldin/codezero) and the **Clean Architecture Principles with .NET Core**.

Central organizing structure, decoupled from frameworks and technology details.

Built by small components that are developed and tested in isolation.

# Goals

CodeZero Template is implementation of [CodeZero Framework](https://gitlab.com/nasraldin/codezero).

The goal of this project is to provide an open-source a Clean Architecture solution, DDD, SOLID, TDD as well as a containerized microservice as a ready solution to help developers and companies to use in production and focus on other business parts in development.

<br/>

# Overview

<br/>

### ApplicationCore

This will contain all entities, enums, exceptions, interfaces, types and logic specific to the domain layer. No dependencies on any other layer or project. This layer defines interfaces that are implemented by outside layers. For example, if the application need to access a notification service, a new interface would be added to application and an implementation would be created within infrastructure.


### Infrastructure

This layer contains all application logic and classes for accessing external resources such as file systems, web services, smtp, and so on. These classes should be based on interfaces defined within the core layer. It is dependent on the core layer, but has no dependencies on any other layer or project.

### Services

This layer is a RestApi application based and ASP .NET Core WebAPI. This layer depends on the Infrastructure layer.

# Getting Started

To use this template, there are a few options:

- [Install the Visual Studio Template](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeZero.Template) and use it within Visual Studio
- Download this Repository
- Install using `dotnet new` (see below)

These are all covered below.

[![Nuget Demo](https://gitlab.com/nasraldin/codezero-template/-/raw/dev/.imgs/Screenshot-2021-05-27-204153.png)]()

## Using the Visual Studio Item Template

After installing the template, you should be able to create a new project in Visual Studio and search for CodeZero Template. You should see the template appear in your list of project templates:

[![Install CodeZero.Template](https://gitlab.com/nasraldin/codezero-template/-/raw/dev/.imgs/Screenshot-2021-05-27-212746.png)]()

[![Install CodeZero.Template](https://gitlab.com/nasraldin/codezero-template/-/raw/dev/.imgs/Screenshot-2021-05-27-212936.png)]()

After choosing this template, provide a project name and finish the project creation wizard. You should be all set.

[![Sloution Explorer](https://gitlab.com/nasraldin/codezero-template/-/raw/dev/.imgs/Screenshot-2021-05-27-211359.png)]()

Note that the template is generally only updated with major updates to the project. The Gitlab/GitHub repository will always have the latest bug fixes and enhancements.

## Using the dotnet CLI template

First, install the template from [NuGet (https://www.nuget.org/packages/CodeZero.Template)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CodeZero.Template):

```powershell
dotnet new -i CodeZero.Template
```

You should see the template in the list of templates from `dotnet new` after this install successfully. Look for "CodeZero Template" with Short Name of "codezero".

[![Install CodeZero.Template](https://gitlab.com/nasraldin/codezero-template/-/raw/dev/.imgs/Screenshot-2021-05-27-204430.png)]()


```powershell
dotnet new codezero --help
```

[![codezero --help](https://gitlab.com/nasraldin/codezero-template/-/raw/dev/.imgs/Screenshot-2021-05-27-211507.png)]()

Navigate to the directory where you will put the new solution.

Run this command to create the solution structure in a subfolder name `Your.ProjectName`:

```
dotnet new codezero -o Your.ProjectName
```

The `Your.ProjectName` directory and solution file will be created, and inside that will be all of your new solution contents, properly namespaced and ready to run/test!

Example:
[![Create new project](https://gitlab.com/nasraldin/codezero-template/-/raw/dev/.imgs/Screenshot-2021-05-27-204817.png)]()

## Build & Run

Build CodeZero docker images, execute the following command:
For Mac/Linux .sh
For Windows .ps1

1- Generate self-signed certificates for local development
```sh
$ cd .cert; ./dotnet-cert.sh && sudo ./hosts.sh add; popd;
```
2- build docker images
in app root path
```sh
$ ./up.sh; popd;
```

Then the following containers should be running `docker ps`:

| Application 	    | URL                      | Alias                         |
